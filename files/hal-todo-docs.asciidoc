== Overview
(TK: data goes here)

== RFC2119 Words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC2119].

== Media Type Support
All server response bodies SHOULD be returned using the xref:hal-json[HAL+JSON Media Type]. All client write request bodies (e.g. POST and PUT) MUST be sent using the  
xref:plain-json[JSON Media Type]. All client read requests (e.g. GET) MUST
be sent using xref:query-strings[URL Query] strings.

== Supported Operations and Link Relation Values
Below is the list of link relation values and the operations they perform.

[[self]]
=== Reload the Current Representation : +rel="self"+
The +self+ link relation value identifies the link used to reload the current resource representation.



== Data Elements
the following data elements are used in the Task Service. All server and client
applications should be ready to handle these data elements for display and processing.

== Media Types and Query Strings
Below is a list of payloads and query strings that can be sent from the client 
to the server along with a list of the common server responses.

[[hal-json]]
=== HAL Media Type : +application/vnd.hal+json+
The link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06[HAL Media Type] (as
described in draft-kelly-json-hal-06) is used to send responses from the server to the client. 

Client applications SHOULD support and the MUST and SHOULD-level elements in the HAL media type specification.

[[plain-json]]
=== JSON Media Type : +application/json+
The link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159[JSON Media Type] (as
described in RFC7159) is used to send updates from the client to the server. 
Essentially, this means clients build payloads using plain JSON objects with a set of name/value pairs.

For example, if the hypermedia control indicates an arguments named +title+ and +completed+ can be sent to the server, the client can format a payload that looks like the following:

.JSON Payload
----
{
  "title" : "this is a new task",
  "completed" : "false"
}
----

[[query-strings]]
=== URL Query Strings
The link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3[URI Query] (as described in 
RFC3986, is used to send read-only queries from the client to the server. Essentially, 
this means clients build URL query strings using a name/value pair approach.

For example, if the hypermedia cxontrol indicates an argument named +title+ can be
sent to the server, the clienht can format a query URL that looks like the following:

.URL Query String
----
http://example.org/?title=this+is+a+test
----
